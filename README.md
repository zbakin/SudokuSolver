# SudokuSolver

Simple Sudoku Solver

The idea is the have a function('isSolvable()') which checks all possible VALID numbers from 1 to 9 on empty place and recursively call the same function with updated number to check the next empty position. There are some helper functions such as 'isValidPosition()', 'printBoard()', 'hasEmpty()' and some others.
